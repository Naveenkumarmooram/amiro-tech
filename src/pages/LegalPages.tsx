    { title: 'Who we are and what this notice covers', content: <p>Amiro Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd (“Amiro Tech”, “we”, or “us”) operates this website. This notice explains information handling for website enquiries and career applications. Client projects and software products may be covered by separate privacy notices and agreements.</p> },
    { title: 'Information you share with us', content: <><ul><li><strong>Business enquiries:</strong> name, email address, optional company and phone number, service or product interests, and your message.</li><li><strong>Career applications:</strong> the resume, experience, location, availability, and project links you choose to send.</li></ul><p>Please do not include passwords, payment details, identity documents, or confidential client information.</p></> },
    { title: 'How submissions work', content: <p>When the contact form prepares an email draft, you must send it through your email service. If direct submission is enabled, the form sends the entered details to our server and then through Resend to our company inbox. Career applications open your chosen email service; clicking Apply or copying details does not submit an application or upload a resume.</p> },
    { title: 'Use of information', content: <p>Information provided in an enquiry is used to understand and respond to that request and discuss relevant services or products. Application information is used to consider the role you applied for and communicate about recruitment. A product-interest request does not automatically subscribe you to a marketing mailing list.</p> },
    { title: 'Service providers and international processing', content: <p>Hosting and email providers process information necessary to deliver their services. Following a webmail, social media, or map link brings you to a separate service governed by its own privacy notice. Depending on the provider, information may be processed outside India. Contact us with questions about the providers involved in your enquiry or application.</p> },
    { title: 'Keeping your information', content: <p>Enquiries and applications sent by email are held in email systems, including any relevant provider records or backups. Closing this website does not delete a message you have sent. To ask how long a particular record is held, or to request its deletion, contact us using the details below.</p> },
    { title: 'Sharing information safely', content: <p>Share only information relevant to your enquiry or application. If a project involves confidential or sensitive material, contact the team to agree an appropriate way to share it before sending. No method of online transmission or storage can be guaranteed completely secure.</p> },
    { title: 'Requests and concerns', content: <p>Contact {email} to ask about your information, request correction or deletion, withdraw a request, or raise a privacy concern. Include enough context to identify your enquiry without sending sensitive documents. Verification may be needed, and applicable legal or contractual obligations may affect what can be deleted. This notice does not limit rights available under applicable law.</p> },
    { title: 'Changes to this notice', content: <p>Review this page for updates when the website’s features or data-handling practices change. See also our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookies & External Services</a> notice.</p> },
